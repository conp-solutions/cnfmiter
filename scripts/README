This directory provides tools to create CNF miters based on simplified CNF
formulas. The CNF is simplified with coprocessor, and the cnfmiter tool is used
to create a miter formula.

### Preparation

The dependencies need to be build. Run the following script to get the
dependencies built:

 ./scripts/build-simplify-miter-dependencies.sh

### Creating a miter CNF

Once the dependencies are available, a miter can be created with the following
call. The script can read and write gzipped formulas.

 ./scripts/create-simplified-miter.sh -o output.cnf[.gz] input.cnf[.gz]
