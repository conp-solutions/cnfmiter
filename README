cnfmiter, Norbert Manthey

This tool allows to produce a formula with is unsatisfiable in case the 2 given
formulas as equivalent, i.e. all models are the same for all variable in both
formulas.

Usage:

# Read 2 (gzipped) CNF files, and print the miter formula to stdout
./cnfmiter formula1.cnf(.gz) formula2.cnf(.gz) > miter.cnf


In case the CNFs contain an input that uses X variables, and one or both
formulas furthermore introduce auxiliary variables, e.g. because of the Tseitin
encoding, then this tool can still compare the two formulas, by handling the
auxiliary variables special.

# compare the Tseiting encoding of some input with X variables in the input
./cnfmiter -t X formula1.cnf(.gz) formula2.cnf(.gz) > miter.cnf


As miter formulas for working comparisons result in unsatisfiable formulas, we
also want to be able to generate similarly structured satisfiable formulas. This
can be achieved by dropping some clauses from one of the input formulas. The
following command allows to randomly drop N clauses from the first formula:

# drop N clauses from the first formula before creating the miter formula
./cnfmiter -r N formula1.cnf(.gz) formula2.cnf(.gz) > miter.cnf
